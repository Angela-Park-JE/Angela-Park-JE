## 👋 Hi, I’m Jung Eun Park.
I'm a baby data analyst🤓. TIL_ver1 is currently what repository I use, 2022~2024.  
I dream of growing up every day, step by step.  

    'Better today than yesterday, better tomorrow than today!'

- 👀 I’m interested in **time series data(especially anomaly detection)** and **user profiling for identifying and judging anomalies**.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying: analyzing in a business perspective, visualizing for proper communication, practical statistics for data analysis. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to work in game industry or mobility industry data analyzing projects.  
- 🔥 **But what I truly want to do is working with workmates who are passionate and responsible with good hearts**. I'll be the one like that to you.
