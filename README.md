I dream of growing up every day, step by step. Thank you for visiting me!

    'Better today than yesterday, better tomorrow than today!'

- 👀 I’m interested in **Time Series Data**(especially **Anomaly Detection**) and **User Profiling** for identifying and judging anomalies.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying: analyzing in a <span style="color:Green">business perspective</span>, <span style="color:Green"> visualizing </span> for proper communication, <span style="color:Green"> practical statistics </span>  for data analysis. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to work in game industry or mobility industry data analyzing projects.
